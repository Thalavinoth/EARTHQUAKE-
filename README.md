## Project Description

In this project, we aim to predict earthquakes by utilizing machine learning techniques. The predictive model is built on a dataset containing seismic activity data, geographical information, and other relevant features. The goal is to provide early warning or forecasting of potential earthquake events, which can be invaluable for disaster preparedness and risk mitigation.

## Dataset

We used the following dataset for this project:

- **Dataset Name**: [Earthquake Prediction Dataset](link-to-dataset)
- **Description**: This dataset contains seismic and geological data, including earthquake magnitudes, depths, geographical coordinates, and various other relevant features.

## Pre-requisites
